# A Hybrid Data-Driven Approach for Modeling Post-Earthquake Housing Recovery

## Overview
This repository contains supplemental materials for the paper titled **"A Hybrid Data-Driven Approach for Modeling Post-Earthquake Housing Recovery"**, published in *Earthquake Spectra* (2025). The study presents a hybrid data-driven framework for modeling post-earthquake housing recovery at both individual building and community levels.

## Methodology
The research employs a dual-level analytical approach:

**Individual Building Level:**
- Probabilistic Bayesian estimation framework combining Metropolis-Hastings MCMC and Empirical Bayes methods
- Estimation and updating of parameters for key temporal variables:
  - Recovery time
  - Financing time
  - Delay time
  - Inspection time
  - Repair time

**Community Level:**
- Machine learning ensemble for predicting individual building recovery times
- Generation of comprehensive recovery trajectories for affected buildings
- Implemented algorithms include:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Machine
  - Decision Tree
  - Extreme Gradient Boosting
